# Hi there üëã, I'm Daniel.

I'm a Technical Lead and final-year Computer Science student based in Newcastle, Australia.

### About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at the University of Newcastle and currently work as the Technical Lead at Impact Apps.

For the past few years, I've been responsible for the company's technology stack, which serves over 100,000 users across Australia. I enjoy the full lifecycle of software development, from high-level system architecture and building out CI/CD pipelines down to quickly prototyping new projects and hands-on security auditing.

I'm always looking to learn and am passionate about the challenge of building reliable, scalable, and user-friendly software.
